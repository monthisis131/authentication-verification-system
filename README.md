# 🔐 Authentication & Verification System

Hi there 👋

This is a secure backend application built using **Spring Boot** that
handles user authentication with **JWT** and **email OTP verification**.

The goal of this project is to simulate how real-world applications
manage **secure login systems**, **user verification**, and **stateless
authentication**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔑 User Registration with Email Verification (OTP)
- 🔐 Secure Login using JWT Authentication
- 📩 Email Service Integration (SMTP - Gmail)
- ⏳ OTP Expiry Handling (15 minutes)
- 🔁 Resend Verification Code
- 🛡️ Protected APIs using JWT Token
- ⚡ Stateless Authentication (Spring Security)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- ☕ Java\
- 🌱 Spring Boot\
- 🔐 Spring Security\
- 🗄️ PostgreSQL (Supabase)\
- 📧 Java Mail Sender\
- 🔑 JWT (JSON Web Token)\
- 🧪 Postman (API Testing)

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1.  📝 User signs up with email & password\
2.  📩 System sends OTP to email\
3.  ✅ User verifies account using OTP\
4.  🔐 User logs in → receives JWT token\
5.  🚀 Token is used to access secured APIs

---

## 🚀 API Endpoints

### 🔓 Public APIs

- `POST /auth/signup` → Register user\
- `POST /auth/login` → Login & get JWT\
- `POST /auth/verify` → Verify OTP\
- `POST /auth/resend` → Resend OTP

---

## ▶️ Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository\
    git clone https://github.com/VaradM-17/authentication-verification-system

2.  Configure database (PostgreSQL / Supabase)

3.  Add email credentials in `application.properties`

4.  Run the application\
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run

5.  Test APIs using Postman 🚀

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

This project demonstrates:

- Real-world authentication flow\
- Secure API design\
- JWT implementation\
- Email verification system

It's a strong backend project to showcase **Spring Security + JWT
skills**.

---

## ❤️ Final Note

Built with the intention to learn and implement **production-level
authentication concepts** in a simple and clean way.
